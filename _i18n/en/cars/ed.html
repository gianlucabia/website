The rigidity of the single-seater and above all the safety of the rider is guaranteed by the carbon fiber monocoque (with a weight of only 23 kg) we have developed: this allows us to be both powerful and safe at the same time.
<br>
We have fully developed the entire electronic compartment by also providing traction control, regenerative braking and torque vectoring on the 4 wheels.
