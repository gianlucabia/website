description: Race UP Team and Joanneum Racing Graz together again
---

The Joint test session held in Pista Azzurra (Jesolo VE) from 28/11 to 30/11 between the Race UP Team and Joanneum Racing Graz finished 2 days ago.

## The meeting
The technical nature of the track coupled with low temperatures experienced during the test days put under great pressure both the handling and the reliability of the two cars involved: the MG 11.16 from Padua and the JR16 from Graz.

## Three days of test, test, test
The 3 test days have been extremely important as they enabled the two teams to acquire valuable information to be used in the next season. Just as important was the possibility to consolidate the already excellent relationship between the two teams through a mutual exchange of competencies and know-how.

## Always learning
Race UP Team's fundamental objectives are growth and innovation, being able to cooperate with a Top Team such as Joanneum Racing Graz has been a precious and constructive opportunity!
