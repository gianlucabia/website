		<p>
			Race Up is the Formula SAE Team of the University of Padova. Every year we set the ambitious goal of conceiving and producing from scratch a car that can compete against those from the best Universities around the world in this international competitive automotive contest. Thanks to the nature of this project and our approach to work, we redefine the very concept of university education. In our history, we have gained many important awards, guaranteeing excellent visibility to our sponsors and balancing their needs with professionalism.

						<strong>Formula SAE</strong>
						<br>
						<i>International design competition.</i>
						<br>
						Established in 1981, this competition envisions the design and the production of a car made in a formula style, which will be measured in a series of static and dynamic tests and will be evaluated by a team of engineers and experts. The multidisciplinary side of this project is ensured by the very nature of these trials, which include, among others, the development of a business plan for the implemented model. The objective of SAE Formula is to foster the professional development of students in the fields of: design, project planning, team building, communication and project management. The Formula SAE is today spread all over the continents and is held in circuits such as Hockenheim ring, Silverstone, Montmelò and Autodromo Paletti.
						<br>
						The basic idea of the Formula SAE is that a dummy company commits to the team the realization of a prototype of a racing car for non-professional pilots and which respects well-defined technical features.

					"Universa universis patavina libertas", this is the motto that has always characterized the University of Padova, recognized for the cultural opening and the freedom of expression that pushed for centuries a group of students and teachers to leave the University of Bologna for Padova. These factors converge in Race Up, which contributes to making the University of Padova a benchmark for excellence in international training and research studies.
